    <h2>Fantasy of Okku</h2>

    <p>Fantasy of Okku is a fast and light tabletop roleplaying game with a darkly whimsical fantasy theme.</p>

    <p>Fantasy of Okku is written in the world of Okku, a fleshed-out, politically-driven planet with factions, economies, wild creatures, and a class system. Explore scenic towns and tundras of extreme altitude, venture into dangerous cave systems and megadungeons, collect treasures, socialise with hand-written characters, engage with creative monsters, and gain experience forever! The game lasts only as long as you can survive, and maybe even beyond that.</p>

    <p>Enjoy a chilled out dark fantasy experience. Smoke a pipe in a tavern with a robed knight. Travel to the local fungal forest. Plot a coup of the demon senator Galgatos. Don't waste time learning complex rules or calculating, just enjoy role playing and accomplishing your goals. </p>
